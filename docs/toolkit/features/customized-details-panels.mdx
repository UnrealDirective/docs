The Unreal Directive Toolkit provides multiple enhancements to the Unreal Engine Editor Details Panel.

# Static Mesh Actor

The Static Mesh Actor’s Details Panel has been customized to provide enhancements —

## Push Materials to Source

To simplify pushing materials from a Static Mesh Actor’s overridden material slots to the source meshes material slots, a new `Push Materials to Source` button was added. This removes the need to open up the source mesh itself and manually copy the materials one-by-one.

- This functionality works on all Static Mesh Actors selected in editor viewport
