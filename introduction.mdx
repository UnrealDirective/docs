## Overview

The Unreal Directive Toolkit (UDToolkit) is an Unreal Engine plugin geared towards improving the quality of life of Unreal Engine developers. Currently, the toolkit is in it's alpha phase with new features being added over time.

The Unreal Directive Toolkit is limited to [Patrons](https://patreon.com/unrealdirective) & [Supporters](https://unrealdirective.com/support).

## Requirements

The Unreal Directive Toolkit is currently limited to the following specifications —

| Specification    | Requirements |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Operating System | Windows 10+  |
| Unreal Engine    | 5.1+         |

## Installation

The Unreal Directive Toolkit plugin should be installed in your Unreal Engine plugins directory —
`e.g., C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.1\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace\*`

![Install Location](/images/install-location.png)

> Placing the plugin in another directory, such as outside of the Marketplace directory, can result in projects failing to package. This is due to a build restriction placed in Unreal Engine 5 for third-party plugins.
