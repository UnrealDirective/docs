## Overview

The Duplicate Asset Consolidation Tool is a feature of the Unreal Directive Toolkit that helps users identify and consolidate duplicate assets within their projects. It allows users to compare two directories, a source and a target, and lists all duplicated assets found within them. From there, users can choose to consolidate the assets either selectively or all at once.

To use the tool, simply select the source and target directories and click "Scan for Duplicates." The tool will then display a list of all the duplicate assets found in the directories. Users can choose to consolidate individual assets by clicking the "Consolidate" button next to each asset, or they can consolidate all assets at once by clicking the "Consolidate All" button.

The Duplicate Asset Consolidation Tool is a useful feature for organizing and cleaning up large projects, as it helps users identify and eliminate unnecessary duplicates that may be scattered throughout their project. It has been tested on projects with over 100GB of assets and has shown great results in terms of efficiency and organization.

## Instructions

To use the Duplicate Asset Consolidation Tool, follow these steps:

1. Open the Unreal Engine editor and select the "Unreal Directive" menu.
2. From the menu, select "Duplicate Asset Consolidation." This will open the tool in a new window.
3. In the "Source Directory" field, enter the path to the directory that you want to search for duplicates. This will typically be the directory that contains the main project files.
4. In the "Target Directory" field, enter the path to the directory that you want to compare to the source directory. This could be a separate project directory, plugin, or game feature.
5. Click the "List Duplicate Assets" button. The tool will search the source and target directories for duplicated assets and display a list of all the duplicates found.
6. To consolidate individual assets, click the "Consolidate" button next to each asset that you want to consolidate.
7. To consolidate all assets at once, click the "Consolidate All" button.

Note: Consolidating assets will merge the assets into a single instance and delete the duplicates. Make sure to double-check the list of duplicates before consolidating to ensure that you do not accidentally delete any assets that you need.
