## Overview

![](/images/toolkit/actor-finder.png)

Version 0.5 of the Unreal Directive Toolkit (UDToolkit) introduces multiple major changes in it’s implementation.

First and foremost, each of the tools are being transitioned from the Editor Utility Widgets to a new UI framework, Qt/PySide6, starting with the Actor Finder. This change was implemented to provide me increased flexibility in the development of these tools while simultaneously ensuring a dependable and highly optimized framework.

Secondly, the Actor Finder has seen multiple improvements with it’s rework. Multiple filters can now be added at once, and the “Find Actors’ option doesn’t automatically select all found actors. In addition, multiple new filters have been added and existing filters have been improved.

Lastly, all of the filters available by the Actor Finder are baseline established in the Editor Actor Subsystem Enhanced module. This allows developers to build their own custom tools without being limited by the toolkit.

As always, I appreciate your feedback and support. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for future improvements, feel free to let me know in the udtoolkit-feedback Discord channel.
