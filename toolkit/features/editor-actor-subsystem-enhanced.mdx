title: "Editor Actor Subsystem Enhanced"
description: "The Editor Actor Subsystem has been subclassed an enhanced with additional functionality. All functions listed are available via C++ and Blueprints."
---

The build-in Editor Actor Subsystem comes with quite a few helpful functions, however they are not enough. Therefore, I've went ahead and added quite a few more functions to the subsystem. All functions listed are available via C++, Blueprints, and Python.
