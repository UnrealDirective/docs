## Requirements

The Unreal Directive Toolkit is currently limited to the following specifications —

| Specification    | Requirements |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Operating System | Windows 10+  |
| Unreal Engine    | 5.1+         |

## Installation

The Unreal Directive Toolkit plugin should be installed in your Unreal Engine plugins directory —
`e.g., C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.xx\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace\*`

> Placing the plugin in another directory, such as outside of the Marketplace directory, can result in projects failing to package. This is due to a build restriction placed in Unreal Engine 5 for third-party plugins.

## Enabling the Plugin

With the engine open, navigate to your plugins window and enable the **Unreal Directive Toolkit** plugin. This can be found under the **Installed/Unreal Directive** category.
